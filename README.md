# Backpropagation Implementation using Numpy

An exercise of backpropagation implementation with Numpy from the [Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program](https://eu.udacity.com/course/ai-programming-python-nanodegree--nd089).

## Usage
The following instructions assume that you:
1. Have git installed on your machine. If not, you can click [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to set it up.
2. Have a package manager installed. The following instructions use [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) but [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) works just as well.

First, clone the repository with git:

`git clone https://github.com/ge0ra/BackpropagationImplementationNumpy.git`

Then, open your terminal and change the current working directory into the repository

`cd ../BackpropagationImplementationNumpy`

Install the following packages:
1. Python 3.7: `conda install python==3.7`
2. Numpy 1.16: `conda install numpy==1.16`


## How to use
Simply run the following command:

`python backprop.py`
